Subductīs nāvibus conciliōque Gallōrum Samarobrīvae perāctō, quod eō
annō frūmentum in Galliā propter siccitātēs angustius prōvēnerat, coāctus
est aliter ac superiōribus annīs exercitum in hībernīs collocāre legiōnēsque in
plūrēs civitātēs distribuere; \\

\subsection*{4}
Defertur ea rēs ad Caesarem. Ille veritus, quod ad plūrēs pertinēbat, nē cīvitās eōrum impulsū dēficeret, Lucium Plancum cum legiōne ex Belgiō celeriter in Carnūtēs profīciscī iubet ibique hiemāre quōrumque operā cognōverat Tasgetium interfectum, hōs comprehēnsōs ad sē mittere.\\

\subsection*{3}
Cum celeriter nostrī arma cepissent vallumque adscendissent atque ūnā ex parte Hispānīs equitibus ēmissīs equestrī proeliō superiōrēs fuissent, dēspērātā rē hostēs suōs ab oppugnātiōne redūxērunt.\\

Mittitur ad eōs colloquendī causā Gaius Arpīnēius, eques Rōmānus, familiāris Quintī Titūrī, et Quintus Iūnius ex Hispāniā quīdam, quī iam ante missū Caesaris ad Ambiorīgem ventitāre cōnsuērat; apud quōs Ambiorīx ad hunc modum locūtus est:\\

\subsection*{2}
sēsē prō Caesaris in sē beneficiīs plūrimum eī cōnfitērī debēre, quod eius operā stīpendiō liberātus esset, quod Aduatucīs, fīnitimīs suīs, pendere cōnsuēsset, quodque eī et fīlius et fratris fīlius ab Caesare remissī essent, quōs Aduatucī obsidum numerō missōs apud sē in servitūte et catēnīs tenuissent; \\

neque id, quod fēcerit de oppugnātiōne castrōrum, aut iūdiciō aut voluntāte suā fēcisse, sed coāctū civitātis, suaque esse eiusmodī imperia, ut nōn minus habēret iūris in sē multitūdō quam ipse in multitūdinem.\\

\subsection*{4}
Cīvitātī porrō hanc fuisse bellī causam, quod repentīnae Gallōrum coniūrātiōnī resistere nōn potuerit. Id sē facile ex humilitāte suā probāre posse, quod nōn adeō sit imperītus rērum ut suīs copiīs populum Rōmānum superārī posse cōnfīdat.\\
\textbf{State furthermore was this cause of this battle, because they were not able to resist the sudden union of the Gauls. It to be probably to be able to prove this easily from his own humility, which not for a long time he was unskilled of these affairs so that he might confess [he Thought] Roman people to be able to be overpowered by his own troops.}

\textbf{Gauls could not easily deny Gauls, especially when plan seems to beginning to recover sshared freedom. }

\subsection*{7}
Quibus quoniam prō pietāte satisfēcerit, habēre nunc sē ratiōnem officī prō beneficiīs Caesaris: monēre, ōrāre Titūrium prō hospitiō, ut suae ac mīlitum salūtī cōnsulat.\\

\section*{28}

\subsection*{1}
Arpinēius et Iūnius, quae audīerunt, ad lēgātōs dēferunt. Illī repentīnā rē perturbātī, etsi ab hoste ea dīcēbantur, tamen nōn neglegenda exīstimābant maximēque hāc rē permovēbantur, quod cīvitātem īgnōbilem atque humilem Eburōnum suā sponte populō Rōmānō bellum facere ausam vix erat crēdendum. \\
\textbf{Arpenius and Junius brought what they heard to them having been perturbed with unexpected affair, although these things were spoken by the enemy, that they nonetheless were thinking that these things might not be neglected they arose and they were greatly moved through this with things, because it was barely needing to be believed that ignoble state and humble Eburnes dared to make war by their own will against the Roman people.}

\textbf{And thus they spoke affairs to the council and great controvery arose about them}

\subsection*{3}
Lucius Aurunculēius complūrēsque tribūnī mīlitum et prīmōrum ōrdinum centuriōnēs nihil temerē agendum neque ex hībernīs iniūssū Caesaris discēdendum exīstimābant: quantāsvīs magnās etiam cōpiās Germānōrum sustinērī posse mūnītīs hībernīs docēbant: rem esse testimōniō, quod prīmum hostium impetum multīs ultrō vulneribus illātis fortissimē sustinuerint: rē frumentāriā non premī; intereā et ex proximīs hībernīs et ā Caesare conventūra subsidia: postrēmō quid esse levius aut turpius quam, auctōre hoste, dē summīs rēbus capere cōnsilium?\\
\textbf{L Aurunculaeus and many tribunes of soldiers and centurions of the first order estimated that nothing is needing to be done heedlessly, and no one must set forth from winter camps without orders of Caesar: they also taught that with however many great troops of Germans to be able to be sustained with fortified winter camps: that the matter served as evidence, because enemy, having obtained this victory, confident they will be victorious in perpetuity,  first enemy attack they already sustained with wounds having been given voluantarily with bravery that covering grain supply they were not pressed meanwhile, both from neighboring winter camp and from Caesar aid  convent, at last what is lighter or uglier, than to take up a plant about more important things when enemy is the author?}

\section*{29}
\subsection*{1}
Contrā ea Titūrius sērō factūrōs clāmitābat, cum māiōrēs manūs hostium adiūnctīs Germānīs convēnissent, aut cum aliquid calamitātis in proximīs hībernīs esset acceptum. Brevem cōnsulendī esse occāsiōnem. Caesarem arbitrārī profectum in Ītaliam; \\
\textbf{In reply to these things Titurnus [Sabinus] kept shouting that they will be late, when they would after be by great enemy band arrival of troops from Gemans having been joined, or after some calamity in neighboring winter camps was accepted. That occasion for the purpose of consulting was to be short, that he thought that Caesar set forth to Italy;}

neque aliter Carnūtēs interficiendī Tasgetī cōnsilium fuisse captūrōs, neque Eburōnēs, sī ille adesset, tantā contemptiōne nostrī ad castra ventūrōs esse. \\
\textbf{and not other Carnutes would have adopted an arguement for the purpose of killing Tasgetius, and if they [Caesar] were present, would with great comptempt Eburnes would have come to our camp.}

Nōn hostem auctōrem, sed rem spectāre: subesse Rhēnum; magnō esse Germānīs dolōrī Ariovistī mortem et superiōrēs nostrās victōriās; \\
\textbf{He saw the enemy was not the author, but the situation to be: to be below Rhine served as great grief for the Germans, for the death of german Ariovisti and own greater victory;}

ārdēre Galliam, tot contumēliīs acceptīs sub populī Rōmānī imperium redāctam, superiōre glōriā reī mīlitāris exstīnctā. \\
\textbf{that Gaul is on fire, so much outrage having been accepted under driven back command of the Roman people, with greater glory of things from military having been made extinct}

Postrēmō quis hoc sibi persuādēret, sine certā rē Ambiorīgem ad eiusmodī cōnsilium dēscendisse? \\
\textbf{At last who might pursuade this to themselves, would Ambiorix decend without credible affiars to their council? }

\subsection*{6}
Suam sententiam in utramque partem esse tūtam: sī nihil esset dūrius, nūllō cum perīculō ad proximam legiōnem perventūrōs; sī Gallia omnis cum Germānīs cōnsentīret, ūnam esse in celeritāte positam salūtem. \\
\textbf{that in his opinion in each side was safety: if no danger, indeed they would be nearer to legion, but if all of Gual was conspiring with the Germans, the only hope of safety was in speed.}

\textbf{morever, Cotta and others, who disagreed, destruction had council, in which if present danger would not arrive, truly from long siege hunger must be feared.}

\section*{30}

\subsection*{1}
Hāc in utramque partem disputātiōne habitā, cum ā Cottā prīmīsque ōrdinibus ācriter resisterētur, ‘Vincite,’ inquit, ‘sī ita vultis,’ Sabinus, et id clāriōre vōce, ut magna pars mīlitum exaudīret;\\
\textbf{With these disputed in either part having been hard, when from Cotta and first ranks it was bitterly being resisted, 'Conquer," Sabinus said, "if you want," in a rather loud voice, so that greater part of soldiers could hear,}

\subsection*{2}
‘neque is sum,’ inquit, ‘quī gravissimē ex vōbīs mortis perīculō terrear: hī sapient; sī gravius quid acciderit, abs tē ratiōnem reposcent; \\

quī, sī per tē liceat, perendinō diē cum proximīs hībernīs coniūnctī commūnem cum reliquīs bellī cāsum sustineant, nōn, reiectī et relēgātī longē ab cēterīs, aut ferrō aut fame intereant.’\\

\textbf{It was rising from the plan, they took hold of each other, and beg that they dont lead by their own dissent and stubborness lead things from greatest danger}

\subsection*{2}
facilem esse rem, seu maneant, seu proficīscantur, sī modo ūnum omnēs sentiant ac probent; contrā in dissēnsiōne nūllam sē salūtem perspicere. Rēs disputātiōne ad mediam noctem perducitur. \\

\textbf{Finally Cotta having been moved gave hand; knowledge of Sabinus conquered. It is pronounced they will go out first light.}

\subsection*{4}
Cōnsūmitur vigiliīs reliqua pars noctis, cum sua quisque mīles circumspiceret, quid sēcum portāre posset, quid ex īnstrūmentō hībernōrum relinquere cōgerētur. \\
\textbf{The remaining part of night was consumed by night watch, when each soldier looks around at his own stuff, what can they carry with them, what is forced to leave from instruments of winter quarters. }


\subsection*{5}
Omnia excogitantur, quārē nec sine perīculō maneātur et languōre mīlitum et vigiliīs perīculum augeātur. \\
\textbf{Everything is thought through, why there is no remaing without danger and why danger inreases by wearieness of soldiers and night watches.}

\subsection*{6}
Prīmā lūce sīc ex castrīs proficīscuntur, ut quibus esset persuāsum nōn ab hoste, sed ab homine amīcissimo Ambiorige cōnsilium datum, longissimō agmine maximīsque impedīmentīs.\\
\textbf{At first light they set out from the camps, so that in this way they were persuaded not by enemy but rather plan given by man most friendly named Ambiorix, with battle line and great baggage.}

\section*{32}

\subsection*{1}
At hostēs, posteāquam ex nocturnō fremitū vigiliīsque dē profectiōne eōrum sensērunt, collocātīs īnsidiīs bipertītō in silvīs, opportūnō atque occultō locō, ā mīlibus passuum circiter duōbus Rōmānōrum adventum exspectābant \\
\textbf{But the enemies, after sensing from the roars at night and night watch concerning their departure, with ambus having been put together collected into two parts in the forest, and hving been hidden in a fit place, they looked out waiting about two thousands of paces away for arrival of Romans,}

et, cum sē maior pars agminis in magnam convallem dēmīsisset, ex utrāque parte eius vallis subitō sē ostendērunt novissimōsque premere et prīmōs prohibēre ascensū atque inīquissimō nostrīs locō proelium committere coepērunt.\\

Tum dēmum Titūrius, quī nihil ante provīdisset, trepidāre et concursāre cohortēsque dispōnere, haec tamen ipsa timidē atque ut eum omnia dēficere vidērentur; quod plērumque eīs accidere cōnsuēvit, quī in ipsō negōtiō cōnsilium capere cōguntur. \\
\textbf{While Sabinus finally, who had not forseen anything, was in confusion and rushed and displaced his cohorts, nevertheless he did all these things fearfully, as everything seemed to fail him, all those things, which are accoustomed to fall upon these men who are forced to take up a plan in business itself.}

\subsection*{2}
At Cotta, quī cōgitāsset haec posse in itinere accidere atque ob eam causam profectiōnis auctor non fuisset, nūllā in rē commūnī salūtī dēerat, et in appellandīs cohortandīsque mīlitibus imperātōris et in pugnā mīlitis officia praestābat. \\
\textbf{But Cotta, who did consider this to occur in the journy and for this reasion he was not the cause of departure, was never lacking in the common affairs of safety and stuff for his duty both regards to appealing to troops and exhortation and obligation of soldiers and general in war.}

\subsection*{3}
Cum propter longitūdinem agminis minus facile omnia per sē obīre et, quid quōque locō faciendum esset, prōvidēre possent, iussērunt prōnūntiāre, ut impedīmenta relinquerent atque in orbem cōnsisterent. \\
\textbf{When on account of the long battle line it was less easy to be able to forsee what was needing to done and to increase from each place all through them, they ordered to pronounce, that to abandon baggage and to stand still in a circle.}

\section*{34}
\subsection*{1}
At barbarīs cōnsilium nōn dēfuit. Nam ducēs eōrum tōtā aciē prōnūntiāre iussērunt, nē quis ab locō discēderet: illōrum esse praedam atque illīs reservārī quaecumque Rōmānī reliquissent: proinde omnia in victōriā posita existīmārent.  \\

For their leaders ordered to be pronounced to all the battle line, that no one leave from this place: because the loot of the Romans are reserved for the barbarians, whatever the Romans had left behind, therefore they thought that everything was placed in victory.}
\subsection*{2}
Erant et virtūte et studiō pugnandī parēs; nostrī, tametsī ab duce et ā Fortūnā dēserēbantur, tamen omnem spem salūtis in virtūte ponēbant, et quotiēns quaeque cohors prōcurrerat, ab eā parte magnus numerus hostium cadēbat.  \\

Quā rē animadversā, Ambiorix prōnūntiārī iubet, ut procul tēla coniciant neu propius accēdant et, quam in partem Rōmānī impetum fēcerint, cēdant (levitāte armōrum et cōtidiānā exercitātiōne nihil eīs nocērī posse), \\ 
\textbf{With these things having been noticed, Ambiorix ordered to be pronounced so that at a distance spears were thrown together at a distance, and not approach,and from the parts the Romans made an attack, to yield (with lighter of arms and with other daily training nothing to be able to hurt them)}

\textbf{Nevertheless, the Roman soldiers having been aflicted by so many calamaties, with many parts wounded, resisted, when after a great part of the day was consumed, because there was fighting from first light to 8th hour, there were commiting nothing which would be shameful for themselves. }
